This directory contains a sample EST client application.  It utilizes
OpenSSL for the SSL stack to be used for HTTP requests, libest for 
the EST stack, and OpenSSL 1.0.1 for certificate and crypto operations. 
This README assumes the example EST server is already running on the
local host and listening to port 8085.

To run the example:

1.  Set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to include the directories where libest.so
    and libcrypto.so are installed. 

    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/ssl/lib:/usr/local/est/lib

2.  Set the following environment variable to specify the location
    of the file containing the CA certificates used for verifying
    the server.  In this example we use the trusted certs for
    the example EST server:

    export EST_OPENSSL_CACERT=../server/estCA/cacert.crt

3.  Produce a new private key, connect to the EST server listening on port 8085,
    and request a new certificate.  The example EST server uses the user ID and
    password estuser/estpwd: 

    ./estclient -e -s 127.0.0.1 -p 8085 -u estuser -h estpwd -o /tmp 

    Note: The new private key is stored at /tmp/key-x-x.pem .
    To check the cert response, use this command:

    openssl base64 -d -in /tmp/cert-0-0.pkcs7 | \
        openssl pkcs7 -inform DER -noout -text -print_certs

    Instead of producing a new key along with a (re-)enrollment request,
    you may use an existing key stored in a PEM file
    or generate a fresh one yourself, using for instance the following command:

    openssl ecparam -name prime256v1 -genkey -out privkey.pem

    To use an existing private key for the CSR, supply it using the -x option:

    ./estclient -e -s 127.0.0.1 -p 8085 -u estuser -h estpwd -x privkey.pem -o /tmp

    You may also use an existing CSR for entrollment, supplied using the -y option:

    ./estclient -e -s 127.0.0.1 -p 8085 -u estuser -h estpwd -y req.p10 -o /tmp

4.  Optionally you can request attributes as a single request 
    or as part of the enroll. For a simple attributes request
    use the following command:

    ./estclient -a -s 127.0.0.1 -p 8085 -o /tmp

    To view the list attributes obtained this way, you may use:

    openssl base64 -d -A -in /tmp/csr-0-0.base64 | \
        openssl asn1parse -inform DER
 
    Then you can perform the enroll using this command:
 
    ./estclient -e -a -s 127.0.0.1 -p 8085 -u estuser -h estpwd -o /tmp
 
5.  Optionally, you can use a certificate to identify the EST client
    to the server instead of specifying the HTTP user name/password.  
    Now that you've enrolled a certificate in step #3
    above, you can use that certificate to enroll again. Note, your
    EST server should be configured not to force HTTP authentication. 

    First, convert the pkcs7 cert from step 3 to a PEM cert:

    openssl base64 -d -in /tmp/cert-0-0.pkcs7 | \
        openssl pkcs7 -inform DER  -print_certs -out /tmp/cert-0-0.pem

    Next, save the private key:

	cp /tmp/key-x-x.pem /tmp/savekey.pem

    Next, use this cert as identity to do another enroll operation:

    ./estclient -e -s 127.0.0.1 -p 8085 -c /tmp/cert-0-0.pem \
        -k /tmp/savekey.pem -o /tmp

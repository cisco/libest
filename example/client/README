This directory contains a sample EST client application.  It utilizes
OpenSSL for the SSL stack to be used for HTTP requests, libest for 
the EST stack, and OpenSSL for certificate and crypto operations. 
This README assumes the example EST server is already running on the
local host and listening to port 8085.

To build the example on Windows:

Prerequisite: EST sample applications make use of the GNU getopt library for command line 
              argument parsing. The getopt library is not a part of the C library provided with
              Microsoft Visual Studio. An open source port for getopt exists under the LGPL3 license 
              and must be acquired separately at the link provided below:
              http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/157001/Full-getopt-Port-for-Unicode-and-Multibyte-Microso
              Download the archive which provides the two source files getopt.c and getopt.h and place both 
              source files into the "util" directory.

1.  Set the following environment variables to tell the Gradle build script 
    where to find your installations of OpenSSL and EST

    EST_DIR - must contain the est.lib link file and est.dll binary
              
    
    set EST_DIR=C:\PathToYourLibraryInstalls\EST
    
    SSL_DIR - must contain an "include" subdirectory for the OpenSSL header files,
              a "bin" subdirectory for the OpenSSL dll binaries, and a "lib" subdirectory
              for the OpenSSL link files
    
    set SSL_DIR=C:\PathToYourLibraryInstalls\OpenSSL
    
    PATH - must contain the path to your Visual Studio 2013 VC bin directory 
           prior to any other Visual Studio bin directory and the path to 
           your Gradle executable (which should already be in PATH)
           
    set PATH=C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0\VC\bin;%PATH%
    
2.  From the "example" directory, type:

    gradle -b build_examples.gradle clean
    
    to clean out any prior builds and then:
    
    gradle -b build_examples.gradle build
    
    to build both estclient and estclient_simple executables.
    The executables are placed in the directory shown below:
    
    example\build\exe\estclient\estclient.exe
    
    example\build\exe\estclient_simple\estclient_simple.exe
           
To run the example:

1.  Set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to include the directories where libest.so
    and libcrypto.so are installed. 

    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/ssl/lib:/usr/local/est/lib
    
    On Windows, set the PATH enviromnent variables to where 
    libeay32.dll and ssleay32.dll are installed and where est.dll 
    is installed.
    
    set PATH=C:\PathToYourLibraryInstalls\EST;C:\PathToYourLibraryInstalls\OpenSSL\bin;%PATH%

2.  Set the following environment variable to specify the location
    of the file containing the CA certificates used for verifying
    the server.  In this example we use the trusted certs for
    the example EST server:

    export EST_OPENSSL_CACERT=../server/estCA/cacert.crt
    
    On Windows, the command would appear as follows:
    
    set EST_OPENSSL_CACERT=..\server\estCA\cacert.crt

3.  Produce a new private key, connect to the EST server listening on port 8085,
    and request a new certificate.  The example EST server uses the user ID and
    password estuser/estpwd: 

    ./estclient -e -s 127.0.0.1 -p 8085 -u estuser -h estpwd -o /tmp 

    Note: The new private key is stored at /tmp/key-x-x.pem.
    To check the cert response, use this command:

    openssl base64 -d -in /tmp/cert-0-0.pkcs7 | \
        openssl pkcs7 -inform DER -text -print_certs

    Instead of producing a new key along with a (re-)enrollment request,
    you may use an existing key stored in a PEM file
    or generate a fresh one yourself, using for instance the following command:

    openssl ecparam -name prime256v1 -genkey -out privkey.pem

    To use an existing private key for the CSR, supply it using the -x option:

    ./estclient -e -s 127.0.0.1 -p 8085 -u estuser -h estpwd -x privkey.pem -o /tmp

    You may also use an existing CSR for enrollment, supplied using the -y option:

    ./estclient -e -s 127.0.0.1 -p 8085 -u estuser -h estpwd -y req.p10 -o /tmp

4.  Optionally you can request attributes as a single request or as
    part of the enroll. For a simple attributes request use the
    following command:

    ./estclient -a -s 127.0.0.1 -p 8085 -o /tmp

    To view the list attributes obtained this way, you may use:

    openssl base64 -d -A -in /tmp/csr-0-0.base64 | \
        openssl asn1parse -inform DER
 
    Then you can perform the enroll using this command:
 
    ./estclient -e -a -s 127.0.0.1 -p 8085 -u estuser -h estpwd -o /tmp
 
5.  Optionally, you can use a certificate to identify the EST client
    to the server instead of specifying the HTTP user name/password.  
    Now that you've enrolled a certificate in step #3
    above, you can use that certificate to enroll again. Note, your
    EST server should be configured not to force HTTP authentication. 

    First, convert the pkcs7 cert from step 3 to a PEM cert:

    openssl base64 -d -in /tmp/cert-0-0.pkcs7 | \
        openssl pkcs7 -inform DER  -print_certs -out /tmp/cert-0-0.pem

    Next, save the private key:

	cp /tmp/key-x-x.pem /tmp/savekey.pem

    Next, use this cert as identity to do another enroll operation:

    ./estclient -e -s 127.0.0.1 -p 8085 -c /tmp/cert-0-0.pem \
        -k /tmp/savekey.pem -o /tmp 

Note:  RFC 7030 requires the certificate to be encoded as base64 PKCS7.  This encoding isn't
       very useful for most applications.  The estclient includes the --pem-output option as
       a convenience to convert the newly enrolled certificate to PEM format.  When not using
       the --pem-output option, the following OpenSSL command can be used to convert
       base64 PKCS7 to PEM:

       openssl base64 -d -in /tmp/newcert.pkcs7 | \
           openssl pkcs7 -inform DER -print_certs -out /tmp/savecert.pem
